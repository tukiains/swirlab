# swirlab

swirlab is a Matlab code for modeling shortwave infrared (SWIR) 
radiative transfer and for retrieving atmospheric profiles 
from FTS measurements.

swirlab needs pre-computed absorption cross sections to work (at least
for now, I will soon add routines to compute them)
They can be downloaded from: https://goo.gl/442NoI

swirlab uses MCMC Matlab toolbox by Marko Laine.
