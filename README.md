# swirlab

swirlab is a Matlab code for modeling shortwave infrared (SWIR) 
radiative transfer and for retrieving atmospheric profiles 
from FTIR data.

swirlab needs pre-computed absorption cross sections to work (I will soon add routines to compute them)
They can be downloaded from: https://goo.gl/442NoI

swirlab uses MCMC Matlab toolbox by Marko Laine. 
It is available at: http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/

test_ch4_retrieval.m is a simple example how to run swirlab.
